## Description

This is my first attempt in creating a project in UE4 written in C++ via Visual Studio. This a recreation of the classic game, and the user clicks a block to place their piece. There is no AI implementation in this simplified version. The focus was spent in learning the fundamentals of UE4 coming from a Unity background. The game immediately starts on run, and there the flow of the game is dictated by the text elements that appear during gameplay. A scoreboard is shown to maintain score upon a first non-stalemate victory.


### Dependencies

* Unreal Engine 4
* Visual Studios


## Initial Ideas that went South

- Implement some sort of AI for single player mode (Minimax algorithm based on game-state)
- UI elements for game flow (Did not get to a level of understanding to map button widgets to functions)
- Fun way to place piece (Player wields a sword and slashes at the block they wish to place a piece)
